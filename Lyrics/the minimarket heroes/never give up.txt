Life is struggle facing trouble\n
Stood 2 figth but remain humble\n
Challenge d word 2 archive greatness\n
Feel crush n remain fearless\n
Bet million sweet blood n tears\n
lets make a toast n cheers\n
4 every step every laugh n stories\n
where we are throwing all d noise\n
Running on the path of transition\n
move and act in de grip of passion\n
was almost over and out of track\n
I was able to get up wid my new attack\n
when it feels hard road to light\n
dont just turn away and hide\n
danger waiting you but don't stop\n
make sure you always on the  top\n we never give up
Because life is to fast until we die later\n we never give up
Even to the death we will proud of our GOD\n when i got down
when I got sick\n
when I am search into my heart\n when live is break
When feeling bad\n i beleive in you
